#Phase 3 Prep
Spoke with some Tiger Swallowtails and asked them to recommend specific resources that helped them or that they wished they had reviewed before phase 3. 

They recommend:
1. [Michael Hartl Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/book/ruby-on-rails-tutorial)
2. [Rails Intro 1/2: talks.devbootcamp.com](http://talks.devbootcamp.com/rails-intro-1-slash-2)
3. [Rails Intro 2/2: talks.devbootcamp.com](http://talks.devbootcamp.com/rails-intro-2-slash-2)
4. [RailsGuide: Getting Started with Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
